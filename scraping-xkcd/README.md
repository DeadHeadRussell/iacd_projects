Running this code is really simple. All you have to do is get 'main.html', 'dict.csv', 'd3.js', and 'd3.layout.cloud.js' running on a server, then point your webbrowser at main.html.
The simplest way to do this is to open a terminal to the directory containing these files, then run:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
A really basic python server will be setup (running on port 8000) which will serve the files in the current directory.

This code is not efficient and will hang. Please be patient and it will eventually load.
